          I teach code. I have been teaching code at <a href="http://humber.ca/">Humber College</a>since 2002. Currently I teach code in three programs: <a href="https://mediastudies.humber.ca/programs/graphic-design.html">Graphic Design</a>, <a href="https://mediastudies.humber.ca/programs/multimedia-design-and-development.html">Multimedia, Design and Development</a>, and <a href="https://mediastudies.humber.ca/programs/web-design-interactive-media.html">Web Design and Interactive Media</a>. 
        </p> 

        <p>
          My philosophy of teaching has been built around my experience teaching code. A key part of that experience has been teaching code to students who are not looking to be become career programmers and may only be in the course as it is a requirement. In an attempt to engage these students I have integrated a series of activities: group problem solving, coding art, and coding tangible elements (<a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, and <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/about-ev3">LEGO<small>Â®</small> EV3</a>). 
        </p>

        <p>
          Code in particular must be learned by <a href="/tinkering.html">doing</a>. By trying, failing, failing some more, understanding, and finally succeeding. In class I usually spend about 20% of the class lecturing coding concepts and the other 80% is spent with sample code, in class exercises, and group activities. 
        </p>

        <p>
          I am also an advocate for the use of <a href="/technology-in-the-classroom.html">technology in the classroom</a>. There is a fine balance between using technology appropriately and using technology for technology sake. If used effectively, technology can greatly enhance classroom learning and accessibility.

        <p>
          The best part of being an instructor in the technology field is that the learning never stops. The list of topics I get to teach is continually changing, here are some of the topics I have recently taught in class:
        </p>

        <TeachingTechnologyList technologies={technologies}></TeachingTechnologyList>

        <p>
          One of the best parts about teaching code at a postsecondary institution is the amount of new technology I have to opportunity to work with. I have started a <a href="/learning/list.html">video library</a> of the technology I have worked with.

          <p>
            Having students work on real-life group projects outside of the classroom can be one of the best learning experiences. Below is a list of some of the projects I have facilitated between students and <a href="https://humber.ca/">Humber College</a> or industry partners.

He teaches so nicely, and makes sure we know what we are doing, by explaining LINE FOR LINE what this code does, and codes with us, using notes of course. Adam, it was a pleasure to have you as an instructor, and I\'ll miss seeing you every week, and learning cool new things. I\'d literally love to work for you one day.'}
